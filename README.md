## ðŸŒ» Welcome ðŸŒ» 

Welcome to my GitHub page! 

I am a frontend engineer with a passion for building dynamic and engaging user interfaces. My expertise lies in Javascript and Typescript, and I am always exploring new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web. Accessibility is a key focus in my work, and I strive to create inclusive experiences for all users. 

In my free time, I am also a gamer and a chef, which gives me a unique perspective on user experience and design. I am also fascinated by Notion and APIs, and enjoy experimenting with ways to integrate them into my projects. Thanks for visiting!
